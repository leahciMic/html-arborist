> Parse HTML into a object model, and perform tree surgery.

A library that parses HTML into an object model. Allowing you to perform complex
transforms on the tree of nodes, and stitch it back together producing modified
HTML.

It's a little rough around the edges, not optimised, and not flexible. These
things will change over time. This is the start.
